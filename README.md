### About Me
I focus on data analysis and applied economics, drawing on a foundation in quantitative methods from my economics degree and advanced training from the **MITx MicroMasters in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy**. My work spans the full analytics lifecycle, from architecting foundational data pipelines in **SQL** and **Python** to deploying insights that drive decisions.

> I believe the most robust insights come from moving beyond correlation to understand **causation**. I apply rigorous econometric methods like **Difference-in-Differences** and **A/B testing** using **R** and **Python** to measure true impact. My curiosity is always pushing me to find not just the *'what'* in the data, but the *'why'* behind it.

You can see this approach in my projects below, where I've done everything from engineering automated marketing pipelines to quantifying the causal impact of a sales promotion. Whether the goal is business growth or policy evaluation, my process is the same: use robust technology and sound methodology to deliver clear, actionable answers.
